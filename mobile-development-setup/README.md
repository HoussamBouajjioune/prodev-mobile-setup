# Mobile Development Environment Setup with Expo Go

## Objective

Mobile development requires more computational resources than web development. To ensure a smooth and efficient development experience, we use the **Expo Framework** for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This task focuses on setting up **Expo Go** on your physical device to enable easy testing of React Native apps on real Android or iOS devices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js LTS** installed  
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended IDE)  
- A compatible operating system: **macOS, Linux, or Windows**  
- **Expo Go** installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

---

## Why Expo Go?

Mobile development usually relies on emulators to test apps, which require significant hardware resources and maintenance to keep up with evolving devices (e.g., from iPhone 7 to iPhone 16 Pro Max).  

**Expo Go** offers a cost-effective alternative by allowing you to run React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both Android and iOS platforms seamlessly.

## Steps to Install Expo Go

1. Visit the official Expo Go website: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)  
2. Select the latest SDK version.  
3. Click on **Install** for your device:  
   - **Android:** Install from the **Google Play Store**  
   - **iOS:** Install from the **Apple App Store**  
4. Open the Expo Go app on your device.  
5. Create a new account or log in if you already have one.

## Next Steps

- Use Expo Go to scan QR codes generated by your Expo development server to run and test your React Native apps on your device.
- Document your setup process and any challenges encountered in this README.md to assist with troubleshooting and progress tracking.
